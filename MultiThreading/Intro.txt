> Life Cycle of a Thread (Thread States)

1. New : When a new thread is created
2. Active {start()} : runnable(ready to run) / running(when thread gets the cpu)
3. Blocked / Waiting : Whenever a thread is inactive for a span of time(not permanently). 
4. Timed Waiting : when the thread is inactive for a specific span of time.
5. Terminated : Whenever a thread has finished the execution or any unhandled exception occurs or the thread gets killed forcefully
