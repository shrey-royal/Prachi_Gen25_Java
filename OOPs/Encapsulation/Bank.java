Tasks: Do Any 5

Package:

Scenario 1: Banking System
Create a package called "bank" that contains classes like "Account," "Transaction," and "Customer" that are related to banking operations. Place these classes in the "bank" package to organize and group them together.

Scenario 2: E-commerce Platform
Design a package called "ecommerce" that includes classes like "Product," "Cart," and "Order" that are related to online shopping. Place these classes in the "ecommerce" package to encapsulate and manage them as a cohesive unit.

Scenario 3: Hospital Management System
Develop a package called "hospital" that contains classes like "Doctor," "Patient," and "Appointment" that handle various aspects of managing a hospital. Place these classes in the "hospital" package to provide organization and separation from other modules.

Scenario 4: Game Development
Create a package called "game" that includes classes like "Player," "Enemy," and "Level" that are used in a game development project. Place these classes in the "game" package to maintain a logical grouping of game-related components.

Scenario 5: Social Media Application
Design a package called "socialmedia" that contains classes like "User," "Post," and "Comment" that handle functionalities of a social media application. Place these classes in the "socialmedia" package to keep them organized and separate from other modules.

Access Modifiers:

Scenario 1: Banking System
In a banking system, use the "private" access modifier for sensitive information like customer account balances to restrict direct access to this data.

Scenario 2: Online Store
In an online store application, use the "public" access modifier for methods that provide services to customers, such as adding items to a shopping cart or processing payments.

Scenario 3: University Management System
In a university management system, use the "protected" access modifier for class members that need to be accessed by derived classes, such as a "Student" class accessing the "name" attribute in the "Person" class.

Scenario 4: Employee Database
In an employee database application, use the "default" (package-private) access modifier for methods and attributes that should only be accessible within the same package, such as utility methods or helper classes.

Scenario 5: Travel Booking System
In a travel booking system, use a combination of access modifiers, such as "private" for sensitive data like customer payment details, "protected" for methods used within specific subclasses, and "public" for API methods accessible by external systems.

Encapsulation:

Scenario 1: Vehicle Manufacturing
In a vehicle manufacturing system, encapsulate the internal details of a "Car" class, such as engine specifications and manufacturing processes, to protect sensitive information and provide a controlled interface for interacting with the car.

Scenario 2: Health Tracking Application
In a health tracking application, encapsulate the "User" class's personal health data, such as weight, heart rate, and sleep patterns, to maintain privacy and provide controlled access to the user's health information.

Scenario 3: Online Banking Application
In an online banking application, encapsulate the "Account" class's balance and transaction history to protect the customer's financial information and ensure that interactions with the account are performed through controlled methods.

Scenario 4: Smart Home Automation System
In a smart home automation system, encapsulate the internal workings of devices like "Thermostat" and "LightingController" to provide a simplified interface for controlling and monitoring these devices while hiding complex implementation details.

Scenario 5: Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System
In a CRM system, encapsulate the customer data and methods for managing customer interactions to ensure data integrity, privacy, and controlled access to customer information.
