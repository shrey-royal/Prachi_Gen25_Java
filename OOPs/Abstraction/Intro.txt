Abstraction: in java, abstraction is used to hide the internal details and showing functionality only. Abstract class and interface are used to achieve abstraction in java.

Abstraction can be achieved by two ways in java:
1. Abstract class (0 to 100%) - 0 to 100% is achieved by abstract class.
2. Interface (100%) - 100% is achieved by interface.


Abstract class in java:

> A class which is declared with abstract keyword is known as abstract class in java. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with body).
> Abstract class achieves 0 to 100% abstraction.
> Abstract class can't be instantiated.
> Abstract class can have constructors and static methods also.
> It can have final methods (method with body) which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.
> Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.

Interface in java:

> An interface is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.
> Interface achieves 100% abstraction.
> Since java 8, we can have method body in interface. But we need to make it default method.
> we can have static method in interface.
