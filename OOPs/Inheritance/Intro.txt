Inheritance: It is the process by which one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another. With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.

5 types of inheritance in java:
1. Single Inheritance : one parent and one child class
2. Multilevel Inheritance : one parent and one child class and one grand child class
3. Hierarchical Inheritance : one parent and multiple child class
4. Multiple Inheritance (Through Interfaces)
5. Hybrid Inheritance (Through Interfaces)
