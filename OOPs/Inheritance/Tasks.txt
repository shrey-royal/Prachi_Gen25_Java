Here are 10 problem statements using different types of inheritance in Java:

1. Single Inheritance:
   Create a Java program to model a simple vehicle hierarchy with a base class "Vehicle" and two derived classes "Car" and "Motorcycle."

2. Multilevel Inheritance:
   Develop a Java application for a school management system where you have a base class "Person," a derived class "Student," and another class "Teacher" derived from "Student."

3. Hierarchical Inheritance:
   Design a Java system for managing different types of bank accounts (Savings, Current) using hierarchical inheritance with a base class "Account" and two derived classes "SavingsAccount" and "CurrentAccount."

4. Aggregation:
   Implement a Java program to simulate a library system where you have classes for "Library," "Book," and "Member." Show the relationship between the library and its books using aggregation.

5. Single Inheritance:
   Create a Java program for a simple geometric shapes hierarchy with a base class "Shape" and two derived classes "Circle" and "Rectangle."

6. Multilevel Inheritance:
   Develop a Java application to represent employees in an organization. Create a base class "Employee," a derived class "Manager," and another class "Director" derived from "Manager."

7. Hierarchical Inheritance:
   Design a Java system for modeling different types of animals with a base class "Animal" and two derived classes "Mammal" and "Bird" to showcase hierarchical inheritance.

8. Aggregation:
   Implement a Java program for modeling a computer system with classes for "Computer," "CPU," and "Monitor." Use aggregation to represent the relationship between a computer and its components.

9. Single Inheritance:
   Create a Java program to model a musical instrument hierarchy with a base class "Instrument" and two derived classes "Guitar" and "Piano."

10. Multilevel Inheritance:
    Develop a Java application for a vehicle rental system, with a base class "Vehicle," a derived class "Car," and another class "LuxuryCar" derived from "Car" to demonstrate multilevel inheritance.

These problem statements cover a range of inheritance scenarios in Java, including single, multilevel, hierarchical, and aggregation relationships, which can help you practice and understand the concepts of inheritance in object-oriented programming.
